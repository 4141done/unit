Unit is a lightweight and versatile open-source server

it is a web server
for static media assets,

that runs code in multiple languages,
and a reverse proxy.
It was built by

team members from scratch
to be highly efficient
and fully configurable at runtime.

The latest version is |version|,
released on |release_date|.
